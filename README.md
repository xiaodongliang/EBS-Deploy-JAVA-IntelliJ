## Setup
1. For using this sample, you need an Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). Finally make a copy of client id and client secret. 
2. Please use other ways to translate the source model to the format for Forge Viewer in advance. Get the model base64 urn.
3. Download and build Forge library by Forge JAVA SDK. Copy all * .jar in the target>>lib folder to [libs](libs) folder of this sample. For convenience, these .jar are already included in the project. However please syncronize with Forge JAVA SDK if it has new commits.
4. Open the project of IntelliJ. Add any  libraries if they are missing.

    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR FORGE CLIENT SECRET>>
    export FORGE_TEST_URN=<<YOUR FORGE TEST URN (with urn:)>> 
 
Windows (command line)

    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM FORGE DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR FORGE CLIENT SECRET>>
    set FORGE_TEST_URN=<<YOUR FORGE TEST URN (with urn:)>>
